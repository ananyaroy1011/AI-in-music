Hey shweetuDon't get nervousYou're doing greatIncase you're feeling nervous come hereLet your man give you a few good pats and hoot at you from the crowd and say nasty things and get himself kicked out for being so horny, so atleast for a few mins he steals the limelight from my woman so she can relax and then carry forward hehehe
Shouting this out from the crowdI hope you're alright with that
I want to cuddle to these songs with you as an apology for today AnanyaWill you let me?
Kudl*

This one's Bengali kya? HahaI just got suggested randomlySounds nice but doesn't make sense hehehe
Hey sweetheart
You had a super tiring day emotionally as well as with the event
I hope you had a lot of fun and everything went as planned
And no one caused you any trouble
I still feel bad about the afternoon
I really appreciate you for everything Ananya, you mustn't doubt thatI care a lot about you too and I respect everything you doThat's undoubtedly something you shouldn't have to ask me forI know I sounded a little rough when I was saying something in the morningBut I really didn't have any major bone to pick with you today or any mixed feelings about you in the morning honestlyI just wanted to have your back, support you lots and give you a pep talk or something if you needed it before the eventBut then we spiralled into a bad place where I really wished we didn't headSo I would really like to apologise for it from my endBecause you're more important to me always than winning any conversation
I want you to rest well and feel better in the morning sweetheart 
Good night honey
Just let me know that you're safe and everything's fine alright?
Hey hunI was a little worried about youIs everything alright?
Awwhh I'm sooo glad : ' ))I was just waiting for this text hehehe
That's awesomeJust as you had intended hun?
It iiisss
I want us both to heal not just separately but together too
Wanna celebrate with me on Monday?
I just wanted to leave you some texts in case you looked at your phone and needed a little boost heheh
I know you wereI didn't mind that at all
EXACTLY!! I KNOW!That is one of the reasons I really did not want you to do anything of the sort you were decidingLike not turning upBecause this is a huge thing and I know how you feel with your team and your interactions with themI've heard it from you first hand multiple timesAnd I wanted you to be surrounded by the right people and feel really great about everything and not feel so low
I felt really bad it had come to thisSo I wanted to do anything to not make you feel this way and pull you out of itBecause it was such a silly thing honestly
I want the same AnanyaThat's why I was hoping we could spend Monday together and I want to start meeting you more often now that I've got some really important things taken care ofI want to go on dates, hangout, watch movies, kudl often, make out, laugh, poundIf you'd like that with me
But still, have a really great day if you need time by yourself
I miss you
That's really nice
I'd love that too
I'm fine
Alright
That's from yesterday heheToday's a new day = )
Do you feel I'm not nice to you on a normal day when everything's fine between us and we're texting or talking or when we meet, do you feel I'm rude when we're in person?Like our good moments
If I'm consistently not being nice even on the good days too then heheThen I think we have a problem
But I wouldn't know thatI'm not on the receiving endYou tell me, how do you feelBe honest about everything sweetheart
Heii hehe
Good morning sweetheart
Did you sleep well?
I'd like that too
Awwhh honey
What happened sweetheart?
OH MY GOD YESS
I was thinking about the exact same thing earlier today hahahaha
Hahahahahah I knoooww
I'm sorry sweetheart
You mean a lot to me
I don't want to be an idiot
I want to be an idiot with you though
And do retarded things
I'll work on not getting too mad
You know the tip I gave you long ago hehe
When I'm mad hold me tight and hug me lotsI'll eventually melt
And I know how to make you happy tooFood and kudls and kimses and tickles whenever I get you mad
I love you being yourself hehehehe
This day was super fun honestly

Ananya are you feeling alright?Emotionally? Mentally? Physically I'm aware of but tell me : ' )Are you stressed about anything?Do you need my opinion about anything or want to rant about something and feel lighter?
Okii sooUpdate on this1. It was good, but the flavours didn't go well togetherThe chicken and the rice, completely different flavours and not really well together heheIt was an experiment anyway hehe 2. The chicken and gravy would taste best with bread only, in a sandwich, definitely not with rice3. The quantity was great! So much to eat!
It was just an experiment hahaWon't combine it again with rice, but they were both good individually
Hahahaha yeeepp!!
You always doAlways hang onto me : ' (
SIT ON MY FACE!
Reach for my throat with your hands
Hahahahahahaha I can understand XD
Awwhh sweetheartThat sounds really coolll
I know right??It's damn colorful
Hehehe yuussI'm gonna make it again tomorrow hahahaBut not rice this timeWith bread and cheese The sandwich I had yesterdayKinda like a pizzaYuuuss
Awwhh : ' ))
Honeh how's the new show that you've been watching?Is it getting interesting?
Was today a really busy day hun?
What all interesting things did you have heheheDid Noddy cook up something nice?
How do you find this cabinet hehe?Are you alright with it not being blue?
How long do you sit on the rocking chair for haan?Did you pass out on it yet? Hehe
How do you feel about your privacy at home lately sweetheart?
Huhuhu your man's very inquisitive haanHow do you feel about it?
No nooThey didn't go well with the gravy and chicken hehehe
They were really goodIn the rice itself but not soo great when combined with the chicken and gravy hehe
It's just been a daaayyyI'm gonna let them be for a while and then check on em hehe
Hahahahaha really sweettiiiee?
Oh my gooosshhh I LOVE CHONKY VEGGIES HEHEHEDo you always click food pictures hun? Hahaha
Hey it's alright
Kinda late currentlyWe can always talk tomorrow
Don't worry too much
I understand
I wouldn't want to impose currently
Once you're feeling better I'd like it then
I really just want to be supportive
I thought I'd just add to it if you're having a rough time and you'd have to take out extra time for me alsoSo I'll just not ask you for much for the time being so that you can focus
I kinda got annoyed because we didn't speak much yesterday and when we were speaking you got a call and when you got back from it you just said good nightAnd anyways we were speaking pretty late into the day too
What's a capstone project?I'm great with macros, calories, food quantities and their nutrition (I see those terms being mentioned in the food items)My specialityNeed any help with anything?
1. These are the topics I love to hear and talk about Ananya when we're having a normal conversation over text or when you find a minute or so to call me and vent about this. Because I do the same, vent stuff out just to you because I know you'll listen, If you remember I had asked you yesterday do you want to rant about something or is something bothering you, you just said no. That means you lie a lot to me and you expect me to feel involved and feel good about the whole thing, when it takes some sort of turbulence to get things out of you?
2. Mrigakshi really went overboard with this one, when you had told me about the idea I felt it was pretty smart and something people would like to try out, the fact that she didn't provide any input or help prior to the meeting and wasn't honest about her thoughts but instead thought it was a better idea to finally voice out what she thinks of the whole thing (after all the work was put in with no external inputs) in the actual meeting with the psychologists is just not a good thing to do.It's like washing over someone's hard work, I don't really like what she did and from my perspective of being a third person, I feel she's at fault and she was acting immature.
You have her enough opportunities to provide inputs because I remember this is from almost 2-3 weeks ago, so that's a long span. Her doing that 2 days ago after not listening to a word you said for the past 3 weeks ish was just disrespectful and disregarding of the whole thing.
I don't want to be rude to your friend or take your side, I'm just seeing this from a neutral position and not being biased, she was being an asshole, I don't know why. Don't take this in the wrong way, but1. Was she having her periods?2. Did the guy leave her lately?3. Is she having any personal problems lately?Because something got projected here I feel
You're not crazy, the idea was actually good and your mentor itself agreed and encouraged the whole thing and that guy isn't an idiot. So mrigakshi should make a post out of this on r/AITA and realise that's she's the asshole here.
If it's been stressing you out hun why didn't you reach out to me? What am I even here for then?
Holy shit that chicken breast looks wholesome 
This seems soo cooooolIs it crunchy?What is iiittt???Looks like something baked
Hey honey another thing
Would mum be calmer if she knew you were dating someone and not let her head run so much in such vile directions, instead more streamlined?Like is it something you guys can talk about or have spoken about before?Because I can't haha, my mum doesn't even know I have female friendsA stupid thing happened lately where there were some clothes my sister had gotten recently in my roomMum asked me to explain itI told those are Didi'sShe was like okayThen I went out or something and she went to my sister saying I've something important to talk about FaizanAnd she was like there are some dresses in his room what's going onAnd then she told her the same thingAnd then mum went on about how I'm not supposed to have female friends to her 
HahahaMy house is retarded
So I can't open up about anything, because that's the environment hereBut if your mum is open minded to hear anything then clear the air out atleast a little bitOr we'll just play it safeI don't mind anythingWhatever honestly makes you happyUsually people can't talk to their parents about their relationships that's the situation in India mostlyIt's stupid and orthodox not being able to talk about life in a serious way with your parents hehe
Otherwise we'll just wait for mum to settle currently and I won't hickey your neck if we're meeting for a short span and be safeOki?Whatever makes you happy and most comfortable
DaaaayyyyuummHonestly I didn't know it was such a popular dish hahahaI found out about it I think last year
I didn't see my name hahaha or the recipes
I just saw macros and calories and nutrition info hahaAnd I was likeHeyMy forte
What?!
I DOOO!
