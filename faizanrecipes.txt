Homemade Whole Wheat Bread

Bread has always been close to my heart, since I was introduced to the French bread called Baguette as a kid, I've always wanted to bake a bread myself from scratch. After a lot of failed attempts I've finally nailed it and Oh My God it is so rewarding!

I gotta say homemade bread tastes next level as compared to the store bought one!

⏬ Macros ⏬

Total calories: 1527 Kcals
P: 48 g
C: 237 g
F: 37 g

⏬ Recipe ⏬

Ingredients :
Whole wheat flour : 300 g
Milk : 230 Ml
Olive oil : 25 Ml
Salt : 1 Tsp
Sugar : 15 grams
Yeast : 5 g
Water : (as per requirement)

⏬ Steps ⏬

1. Heat the milk until it's warm (not hot), if you put your finger in it, it doesn't burn, add the sugar to it & add the yeast as let it sit for 10 mins. (If your yeast doesn't bubble within 10 mins that means you need to get a new batch of yeast)

2. Take the flour, add olive oil to it, a tsp of salt, mix it roughly, add the foamed up yeast mix & knead the dough. Don't add any extra water or milk currently, just keep kneading.

3. If the dough hasn't come together yet, add some water (just dashes of it) & knead it until the dough has come together.

4. If the dough feels too firm, add some more water to it and knead it, until you get a soft dough that doesn't stick too much (knead for 15 mins)

5. Add some flour to the base of the container & let it rest for about an hour, once it has doubled in size after the first rise, sprinkle some flour on your workspace & knead it gently again, just barely, not deflating it too much, softly kneading for about a minute or so.

6. Put it in the container that'll go in the oven & let it rise for another hour, after it's nice & fluffy, put it in the oven for 30-40 mins at 200 °C.

7. Once done, let it cool and enjoy the amazing tasting bread!
