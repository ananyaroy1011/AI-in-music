Super cool stuff

Deep tissue massage

I'm safe sweetheart
I just got a little drenched so took a shower
I'd love to get drenched in your pussy juices though Ananya.

Ananya are you feeling alright?
Emotionally? Mentally? Physically I'm aware of but tell me : ' )
Are you stressed about anything?
Do you need my opinion about anything or want to rant about something and feel lighter?

Okii soo
Update on this
1. It was good, but the flavours didn't go well together
The chicken and the rice, completely different flavours and not really well together hehe
It was an experiment anyway hehe 
2. The chicken and gravy would taste best with bread only, in a sandwich, definitely not with rice
3. The quantity was great! So much to eat!

It was just an experiment haha
Won't combine it again with rice, but they were both good individually

Hahahaha yeeepp!!

You always do
Always hang onto me : ' (

SIT ON MY FACE!

Reach for my throat with your hands

Hahahahahahaha I can understand XD

Awwhh sweetheart
That sounds really coolll

I know right??
It's damn colorful

Hehehe yuuss
I'm gonna make it again tomorrow hahaha
But not rice this time
With bread and cheese 
The sandwich I had yesterday
Kinda like a pizza
Yuuuss

Awwhh : ' ))

Honeh how's the new show that you've been watching?
Is it getting interesting?

Was today a really busy day hun?

What all interesting things did you have hehehe
Did Noddy cook up something nice?

How do you find this cabinet hehe?
Are you alright with it not being blue?

How long do you sit on the rocking chair for haan?
Did you pass out on it yet? Hehe

How do you feel about your privacy at home lately sweetheart?

Huhuhu your man's very inquisitive haan
How do you feel about it?

No noo
They didn't go well with the gravy and chicken hehehe

They were really good
In the rice itself but not soo great when combined with the chicken and gravy hehe

It's just been a daaayyy
I'm gonna let them be for a while and then check on em hehe

Hahahahaha really sweettiiiee?

Oh my gooosshhh I LOVE CHONKY VEGGIES HEHEHE
Do you always click food pictures hun? Hahaha

Hey it's alright

Kinda late currently
We can always talk tomorrow

Don't worry too much

I understand

I wouldn't want to impose currently

Once you're feeling better I'd like it then

I really just want to be supportive

I thought I'd just add to it if you're having a rough time and you'd have to take out extra time for me also
So I'll just not ask you for much for the time being so that you can focus

I kinda got annoyed because we didn't speak much yesterday and when we were speaking you got a call and when you got back from it you just said good night
And anyways we were speaking pretty late into the day too

What's a capstone project?
I'm great with macros, calories, food quantities and their nutrition (I see those terms being mentioned in the food items)
My speciality
Need any help with anything?

1. These are the topics I love to hear and talk about Ananya when we're having a normal conversation over text or when you find a minute or so to call me and vent about this. Because I do the same, vent stuff out just to you because I know you'll listen, If you remember I had asked you yesterday do you want to rant about something or is something bothering you, you just said no. That means you lie a lot to me and you expect me to feel involved and feel good about the whole thing, when it takes some sort of turbulence to get things out of you?

2. Mrigakshi really went overboard with this one, when you had told me about the idea I felt it was pretty smart and something people would like to try out, the fact that she didn't provide any input or help prior to the meeting and wasn't honest about her thoughts but instead thought it was a better idea to finally voice out what she thinks of the whole thing (after all the work was put in with no external inputs) in the actual meeting with the psychologists is just not a good thing to do.
It's like washing over someone's hard work, I don't really like what she did and from my perspective of being a third person, I feel she's at fault and she was acting immature.

You have her enough opportunities to provide inputs because I remember this is from almost 2-3 weeks ago, so that's a long span. Her doing that 2 days ago after not listening to a word you said for the past 3 weeks ish was just disrespectful and disregarding of the whole thing.

I don't want to be rude to your friend or take your side, I'm just seeing this from a neutral position and not being biased, she was being an asshole, I don't know why. Don't take this in the wrong way, but
1. Was she having her periods?
2. Did the guy leave her lately?
3. Is she having any personal problems lately?
Because something got projected here I feel

You're not crazy, the idea was actually good and your mentor itself agreed and encouraged the whole thing and that guy isn't an idiot. So mrigakshi should make a post out of this on r/AITA and realise that's she's the asshole here.

If it's been stressing you out hun why didn't you reach out to me? What am I even here for then?

Holy shit that chicken breast looks wholesome ü§§ü§§ü§§

This seems soo coooool
Is it crunchy?
What is iiittt???
Looks like something baked

Hey honey another thing

Would mum be calmer if she knew you were dating someone and not let her head run so much in such vile directions, instead more streamlined?
Like is it something you guys can talk about or have spoken about before?
Because I can't haha, my mum doesn't even know I have female friends
A stupid thing happened lately where there were some clothes my sister had gotten recently in my room
Mum asked me to explain it
I told those are Didi's
She was like okay
Then I went out or something and she went to my sister saying I've something important to talk about Faizan
And she was like there are some dresses in his room what's going on
And then she told her the same thing
And then mum went on about how I'm not supposed to have female friends to her 

Hahaha
My house is retarded

So I can't open up about anything, because that's the environment here
But if your mum is open minded to hear anything then clear the air out atleast a little bit
Or we'll just play it safe
I don't mind anything
Whatever honestly makes you happy
Usually people can't talk to their parents about their relationships that's the situation in India mostly
It's stupid and orthodox not being able to talk about life in a serious way with your parents hehe

Otherwise we'll just wait for mum to settle currently and I won't hickey your neck if we're meeting for a short span and be safe
Oki?
Whatever makes you happy and most comfortable

Daaaayyyyuumm
Honestly I didn't know it was such a popular dish hahaha
I found out about it I think last year

I didn't see my name hahaha or the recipes

I just saw macros and calories and nutrition info haha
And I was like
Hey
My forte

What?!

I DOOO!

My cum first
There's a lot of it
My balls feel heavy

Verrryyy smoof

Hahaha

Sweetheart

I'll start my workout hehe
Kinda late

Homemade Whole Wheat Bread

Bread has always been close to my heart, since I was introduced to the French bread called Baguette as a kid, I've always wanted to bake a bread myself from scratch. After a lot of failed attempts I've finally nailed it and Oh My God it is so rewarding!

I gotta say homemade bread tastes next level as compared to the store bought one!

‚è¨ Macros ‚è¨

Total calories: 1527 Kcals
P: 48 g
C: 237 g
F: 37 g

‚è¨ Recipe ‚è¨

Ingredients :
Whole wheat flour : 300 g
Milk : 230 Ml
Olive oil : 25 Ml
Salt : 1 Tsp
Sugar : 15 grams
Yeast : 5 g
Water : (as per requirement)

‚è¨ Steps ‚è¨

1. Heat the milk until it's warm (not hot), if you put your finger in it, it doesn't burn, add the sugar to it & add the yeast as let it sit for 10 mins. (If your yeast doesn't bubble within 10 mins that means you need to get a new batch of yeast)

2. Take the flour, add olive oil to it, a tsp of salt, mix it roughly, add the foamed up yeast mix & knead the dough. Don't add any extra water or milk currently, just keep kneading.

3. If the dough hasn't come together yet, add some water (just dashes of it) & knead it until the dough has come together.

4. If the dough feels too firm, add some more water to it and knead it, until you get a soft dough that doesn't stick too much (knead for 15 mins)

5. Add some flour to the base of the container & let it rest for about an hour, once it has doubled in size after the first rise, sprinkle some flour on your workspace & knead it gently again, just barely, not deflating it too much, softly kneading for about a minute or so.

6. Put it in the container that'll go in the oven & let it rise for another hour, after it's nice & fluffy, put it in the oven for 30-40 mins at 200 ¬∞C.

7. Once done, let it cool and enjoy the amazing tasting bread!

3. Make a paste out of 200 grams tomatoes & cook until it reduces to 1/4 of the quantity, add the chicken & let it cook and dry up.

4. Spread the chicken on the risen flat bread & top it with cheese (you can top it with olives, corn & other veggies too if you prefer)
